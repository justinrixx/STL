This is a collection of useful data structures, implemented in C++.
They were made to mimic the standard template library, except that
they can be tweaked :). Note though that they have very slightly
different names (vector is Vector, list is List, queue is Queue) and
the iterators are different.

Example:

VectorIterator it = v.begin();
ListConstIterator it = l.crend();
